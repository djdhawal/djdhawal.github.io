Hello!
I'm pursuing the Applied Data Science program at the University of Chicago. Over the past couple of years, I worked as a Systems Software Engineer at HPE, where I focused on machine learning, NLP, and large-scale data engineering.

At UChicago, I’m concentrating on statistical learning, optimization, and computational methods, with the goal of applying them to domains such as financial research and operations management. 

I'm also interested in mathematics and optimization algorithms for large scale data mining.

You can find my resume here: [WIP]
