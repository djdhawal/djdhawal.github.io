Hi Everyone.

I am listing down the papers that I am reading. 

Honestly I don't quite like, how I have to just showcase everything that I am doing in life, because otherwise there's no point of doing anything. Like, I'm not reading papers till I'm not putting them on my website, I am not building projects till they aren't on my github and I don't know anything about tech till I got karma on r/MachineLearning and followers on Twitter. Strange times, I might sound naive. 

The reason why I like tech: I like tech because it makes me feel clever, makes me feel smart about myself. I like reading papers because it humbles me and gives my ego some kool aid. I started reading ML papers back in 2020, that's when I started the DL course by Dr.Ng on coursera, I read the ADAM paper and probably a few more, but couldn't make head or tails out of it. Now with LLMs I'm able to smoothly sail through almost about any paper, I think in a manner, the hill climb to understanding a paper has been replaced by a zip line to the top, I wonder if that would affect the quality of the climbers, and what it would do to the crowd at the top of the hill. 

Nonetheless, here's what I am upto. 
1. LeJEPA: Provable and Scalable Self-Supervised Learning Without the Heuristics (this one's on my list and I'm reading it in installments. I'm intersted in ML Systems, so papers like these are very helpful) [paper link][le-JEPA]

2. Learning Randomized Algorithms with Transformers (I'm learning about both randomized algorithms and transformers, I'm fascinated by both, hence the paper is taking more than a while to get off this list.) [paper link][algo-w-trans]

3. DeepRM : Resource Management with Deep Reinforcement Learning (I really like this one, I thought about this idea and found that it has already been implemented, I'm also taking a class on RL theory and I'm ambitious enough to try and reimplement parts of this paper, stay tuned) [paper link][deep-rm]
