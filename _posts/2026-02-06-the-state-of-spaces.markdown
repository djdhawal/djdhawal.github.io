Hi Everyone.

Today I'll try to walk through another addition to my projects. As I've been reading about probabilistic state space models it became necessary for me to actually model some states. State space models are motivated by the attempt to model the state of a system using some set of parameters say _x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, .. x<sub>n</sub>_ in an _n_ dimensional space. Probabilistic state space models, translate the idea of a state to a Markov process, meaning each state is only defined.
